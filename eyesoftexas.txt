Hullabaloo, Caneck! Caneck!

All hail to dear old Texas A&M
Rally around Maroon and White
Good luck to dear old Texas Aggies
They are the boys who show the real old fight
That good old Aggie spirit thrills us
And makes us yell and yell and yell
So let’s fight for dear old Texas A&M
We’re going to beat you all to

Chig-gar-roo-gar-rem
Rough Tough! Real Stuff! Texas A&M!

Good-bye to texas university
So long to the orange and the white
Good luck to dear old Texas Aggies
They are the boys that show the real old fight
“The eyes of Texas are upon you . . .”
That is the song they sing so well
So good-bye to texas university
We’re going to beat you all to
Chig-gar-roo-gar-rem

Rough Tough! Real Stuff! Texas A&M!
