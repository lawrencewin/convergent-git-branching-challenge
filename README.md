# Community Tech Git Branching Challenge

To practice git branching, I've set up a simple repository of two files, eyesoftexas.txt and hookem.txt.

Currently, the files contain nothing of value, but by merging and combining the right commits and branches, the master branch should end up with the file contents below.

The only rules are that you cannot directly modify a file. You must get the file contents via merge/rebase/cherry-pick unless you're trying to resolve a merge conflict, where, in that case, using vscode or a text editor is acceptable.

## eyesoftexas.txt

The Eyes of Texas are upon you,
All the livelong day.
The Eyes of Texas are upon you,
You cannot get away.
Do not think you can escape them
At night or early in the morn --
The Eyes of Texas are upon you
Til Gabriel blows his horn.

## hookem.txt

\M/ Hook'em Horns! \M/
